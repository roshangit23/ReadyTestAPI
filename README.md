Codeless API Automation Framework

Description

This Rest Assured API Automation Framework is a powerful, user-friendly solution designed to facilitate API testing with minimal coding. Built with Rest Assured, Java, TestNG, Cucumber, Maven, and enhanced by Maven Cucumber Reporting, it streamlines the process of creating and managing API tests.

Key Features

Codeless Test Case Creation: Directly write test cases in feature files. Manage API paths and endpoints centrally in the apiPaths.yaml file, dramatically reducing the need for coding.

Reusable Step Definitions: Broadly applicable step definitions which are generic in nature cover various scenarios, promoting reusability and minimizing script duplication.

Extensive Request and Response Handling: Offers capabilities to set headers, authentication methods, request bodies, query and path parameters, and more.

Complex Data Handling: Efficiently handles complex JSON request bodies, allowing testing of intricate API scenarios.

Dynamic Endpoint Resolution: Seamlessly fetches and constructs endpoints using keys from the YAML file.

Rich Validation Options: Provides a comprehensive set of validations for response status, content, headers, and response time.

Customizable and Scalable: Easily adaptable to different environments and scalable to large suites of API tests.

Detailed Reporting: Integrates with Maven Cucumber Reporting for insightful and detailed test reports.

Getting Started

Cloning the Repository:
Clone the repository from GitHub with:
git clone https://github.com/roshangit23/ReadyTestAPI.git
This downloads the framework to your local machine.

Running a Test Suite:

1)Navigate to the Project Directory: Change to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

2)Run Tests with Maven: Execute the TestRunner class using Maven by running mvn test verify (verify is used for generating reports) in the project's root directory, or directly from your IDE.

3)View Reports: Post execution, find detailed test reports in the target directory, generated by Maven Cucumber Reporting.

Writing and Managing Tests:

1)Feature Files: Test cases are written in feature files located in src/test/resources/features, using Gherkin syntax.

2)YAML Configuration: Manage API paths and base URLs in the apiPaths.yaml file for easy updates and maintenance.

3)Step Definitions: Utilize existing step definitions in ApiStepDefinitions.java for various API interactions. For new scenarios, extend the framework by adding new generic step definitions.

Conclusion
This framework provides a streamlined, codeless approach to API testing, ideal for teams seeking to implement automated testing with minimal programming effort. It ensures maintainability, scalability, and ease of use, catering to both technical and non-technical users.
